Part 1:  Build the Network and Configure Basic Device Settings and Interface Addressing
In Part 1, you will set up the network topology and configure basic settings and interface addressing on routers.
Step 1:  Cable the network as shown in the topology.
Attach the devices as shown in the topology diagram, and cable as necessary.
Step 2:  Configure basic settings for each switch.
Console into each switch, enter global configuration mode, and apply the basic settings and interface addressing. The startup configuration is provided below for each switch in the topology
Switch D1
hostname D1
spanning-tree mode pvst
line con 0
exec-timeout 0 0
logging synchronous
exit
interface range g1/0/1-24
 shutdown
 exit


interface range g1/0/1, g1/0/5-6
 switchport mode trunk
 no shutdown
 exit


vlan 2
 name SecondVLAN
 exit


interface vlan 1
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.0.0.0
 no shut
 exit


Switch D2
hostname D2
spanning-tree mode pvst
line con 0
exec-timeout 0 0
logging synchronous
exit


interface range g1/0/1-24
shutdown
exit


interface range g1/0/1, g1/0/5-6
switchport mode trunk
no shutdown
exit


vlan 2
 name SecondVLAN
 exit


interface vlan 1
ip address 10.0.0.2 255.0.0.0
no shut
exit


Switch A1
hostname A1
spanning-tree mode pvst
line con 0
 exec-timeout 0 0
 logging synchronous
 exit


interface range f0/1-24, g0/1-2
 shutdown
 exit


interface range f0/1-4
 switchport mode trunk
 no shutdown
 exit


vlan 2
 name SecondVLAN
 exit


interface vlan 1
ip address 10.0.0.3 255.0.0.0
no shut
exit
Part 2:  Discover the Default Spanning Tree
Step 1:  Find the root bridge.
issue the command show spanning-tree command all switches
     


     


     
From above it is seen that D2 is the root Port as well as MAC address of D2 is minimum compared to D1 and A1.
Our topology does not really illustrate the difference between port cost and path cost very well, so we will introduce a change in the network to achieve this. At D2, shutdown the g1/0/1 interface. The result of this is that D1 will have to change the port it considers root, and we will then see the
difference between port cost and path cost.
D2(config)# interface g1/0/1    agar topolofy me a1 root hai to ye a1 me karna hai
D2(config-if)# shutdown
Now in d1,
D2# show spanning-tree
     
The root path cost is now 38, while the root port cost is 19. For D1 to reach the root bridge D2, it must traverse two FastEthernet links, and 19 times 2 is 38.
Part 3:  Implement and Observe Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol
On D1, issue the debug spanning-tree events command, and then issue the shutdown command for interface g1/0/1 and observe the output.
D1# debug spanning-tree events
D1# config t
D1(config)# interface g1/0/1
D1(config-if)# shutdown
Now change the mode tp rapid spanning tree mode in D2 and then run no shut comman in D1 also  observe the time taken to connect


            D2(config)# spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
D1(config-if)no shut
   2.Also change the mode of spanning tree in A1 and observe the changes
A1(config)# spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
A1(config)#
Dec 24 13:31:51.023: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Vlan1, changed state to down
Dec 24 13:31:51.081: %LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Vlan1, changed state to up
A1(config)#
A1 was the last switch that was configured for RSTP. As you can see, interface VLAN1 was only down for 0.048 seconds. This is the “rapid” in rapid spanning tree.
